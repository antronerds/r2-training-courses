Welcome
=======
R2 is a publicly accessible web-based program (`http://r2.amc.nl <http://r2.amc.nl>`_  |  `http://r2platform.com <http://r2platform.com>`_) allowing biomedical researchers, without bioinformatics training, to integrate clinical and genomics data. To help (bio)medical researchers get started, we offer this one day R2 Introduction Workshop.

We hope that you will find this day interesting. We would love to hear your thoughts about the workshop. We kindly ask you to fill in the following form during the workshop or at the end of the day: `https://forms.gle/8ZuLprMKQ2xKY3BWA>`_

**Overview of resources**

The two workshop days consist each of a presentation followed by a hands-on session. Experts will be available for questions in the R2 Support Breakout Room.
You can go through online step-by-step guides to do the analyses of your choice yourself and ask questions when needed.

There are two types of step-by-step guides to work through during the hands-on sessions:

* You can choose one of the courses from the left side menu to follow bigger pipelines of multiple coupled analyses to arrive deeper insight into your data. The first course follows the same research line that was performed in a Nature article in 2017.
* You can choose a topic in the Online Tutorial to follow smaller guides about specific analyses of your interest.

Please find an overview of the guides per topic of the presentation with the links below:
