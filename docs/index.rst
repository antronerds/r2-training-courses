Welcome
=======
R2 is a publicly accessible web-based program (`http://r2.amc.nl <http://r2.amc.nl>`_  |  `http://r2platform.com <http://r2platform.com>`_) allowing biomedical researchers, without bioinformatics training, to integrate clinical and genomics data. To help (bio)medical researchers get started, we offer this one day R2 Introduction Workshop.

**Overview of resources**
R2 has many different resources that you can explore to gain a better understanding of the platform and of doing genomics research in general.
Here we list several of these resources.
more options, that you can explore by yourself if you want. You can try to find a publicly available dataset that corresponds to your line of research. Try and see if some of the analysis pipelines from this practical could be applied to that dataset.<br>
* In the navigation bar on the left, you can find several courses that are designed to introduce you to basic R2 analysis pipelines. The pipelines consist of multiple coupled analyses to learn how to gain deeper insight into genomic data. We recommend the first course, `Finding causes in Neuroblastoma genomics data <https://r2-training-courses.readthedocs.io/en/latest/R2IntroductionWorkshop2024_day1.html>`_ , that follows the same research line as was performed in a Nature article in 2017.
* You can check out the <a href="https://r2-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Online R2 Tutorial</a> that provides many smaller step-by-step guides of R2 analyses.
* Check out the <a href="https://hgserver1.amc.nl/cgi-bin/r2/main.cgi?option=dscope_index" target="_blank">Datascope page</a>, where clickable tiles allow you to navigate interesting resources and enter R2 result pages with preset analysis settings. Note that these result pages are interactive, such that you can simply continue your research from any of these pages.
* Past R2 Introduction Workshop material can be found on this page `http://r2platform.com/workshop <http://r2platform.com/workshop>`_
<br><br>If you would like to use R2 for your research in the future, then just visit <a href="http://r2.amc.nl" target="_blank">http://r2.amc.nl</a> and get started. You can <a href="https://hgserver1.amc.nl/cgi-bin/r2/main.cgi?option=about_contact" target="_blank">contact the R2 Support Team </a> with questions about your own research and public or private data set uploads (with public or restricted access).

<br><br>If you encounter discrepancies between the instructions in this course and the R2 platform options, please <a href="https://hgserver1.amc.nl/cgi-bin/r2/main.cgi?option=about_contact" target="_blank">let our R2 Support Team know</a>. We continuously enhance the platform by adding new functionalities and refining existing features. As a result, our documentation and course instructions may occasionally fall behind.
<br>We very much appreciate your feedback!
