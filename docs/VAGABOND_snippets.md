Some small stuff you can try

### Samplemaps

In R2 you can  generate for each dataset 2D (3D for PCA) maps/plots based on several High Dimensional Reduction Clustering algorithms with the limition that a given dataset must contain a minimal amount of samples.  At the moment R2 is supporting PCA, tSNE and UMAP explained in more detail in Chapter 16 of the R2 tutorial [Sample maps:r2-tutorial](https://r2-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tSNE_dimensionality_reduction.html).

For large datasets such as single cel RNA datasets it takes a lot resources for the R2 servers if every user can generate t-SNE or UMAP maps. For this reason for many of the large datasets t-SNE/UMAP maps have been pre-generated by the R2 administrators. 

- In the left menu click "sample maps", search for Neuroblastoma 14 patients or by Author Frank Westerman in the upper  row of the grid. By clicking the select button, the t-SNE map of this single cell dataset is plotted.
- Fortunately, this set has been properly annotated, in the adjustable settings menu select color by track , select at color track cell type and click submit.
- You can also color the cells by gene expression in the select in the Adjustable settings menu, color by gene, and try e.g **PRRX1**

**Do you see something special of the PRXX1 coloring with respect the cell-type clusters ??**
