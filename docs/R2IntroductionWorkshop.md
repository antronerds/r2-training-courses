R2 Introduction Workshop 2022
=======
R2 is a publicly accessible web-based program (http://r2.amc.nl) allowing biomedical researchers, without bioinformatics training, to integrate clinical and genomics data. To help (bio)medical researchers get started, we offer this one day R2 Introduction Workshop.
