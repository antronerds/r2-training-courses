From presentation to your own analysis
=======

Overview
---
The presentations provide a quick glance over most functionalities of R2. Many of these functionalities are described in the [Online Tutorial](https://r2-training-courses.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as well.  

You might wonder how to do the shown analyses yourself. The links below connect the topics of the presentation directly to the respective chapters in the tutorial where step by step instructions guide you through an analysis, which you can perform online within R2 yourself. 

During these steps features related to the respective topic will be introduced, such as additional analyses or visualizations, thereby conveying the ease of using the interconnected R2 interface.   

You choose which modules you find interesting and try them out following the step by step guides on the R2 platform. Above all, we encourage you to tweak the guides to your interest: find datasets that are closely related to your research topic and play around with the modules; fill in settings (genes, gene sets, chromosome locations etc) that are aligned with your research questions.
